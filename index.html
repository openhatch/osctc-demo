        <div class="col-md-8">
<p>Our curriculum covers the practical skills students need to contribute to open source projects, such as using version control, issue trackers, and IRC. It creates connections between students and open source professionals who can explain how the community and culture works. And it gives students the opportunity to make real contributions to active open source projects - all in single day!</p> 
<p>All of our curriculum materials are online, and most activities have instructor walkthroughs and/or screencasts as well. <a href="https://openhatch.org/wiki/Open_Source_Comes_to_Campus/Curriculum">Take a look</a> at what we offer. We're happy to help you adjust the curriculum to meet your needs, and do trainings for any activities or sections you don't feel comfortable with.</p>

Subject: Let's bring Open Source Comes to Campus to COLLEGE_NAME

Hi there! I'm so excited because I found the Open Source Comes to Campus page, and I want to run an event.

My college is called: COLLEGE_NAME

I found the website by: HOW_I_FOUND_THIS_SITE

I'm excited about hosting the event because: SOMETHING_THAT_EXCITES_ME

Let's work together and make an event happen!

Sincerely,

MY_NAME</div>
